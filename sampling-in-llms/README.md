# Sampling in Large Language Models

A practical exploration of sampling techniques used in LLMs. Created for the ["Sampling in LLMs"](https://www.aiunpacked.net/p/sampling-in-large-language-models) issue.

## Sampling Techniques Covered

- **Greedy Decoding**: Deterministic approach selecting highest probability tokens
- **Temperature Sampling**: Control randomness with temperature parameter
- **Top-K Sampling**: Restrict sampling to K most likely tokens
- **Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling**: Adaptively select tokens based on cumulative probability

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository and set up Python environment
2. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook sampling_in_llms.ipynb`

## What You'll Learn

- How LLMs generate text one token at a time
- Why sampling is necessary for creative and diverse outputs
- When to use each sampling technique for different applications
- How to implement and visualize sampling methods
